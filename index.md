title: About Me
---

I'm a software developer and PhD graduate based in London, UK. 

I completed by PhD in 2015 at Imperial College London, studying the application of self-organising governance to computational systems which gather information and knowledge. My work is published in peer-reviewed journals, books and conference proceedings, and can be found on the [research](/research) page.

I have a strong background in software development, taking computer science courses during my undergraduate degree, working on software development projects for several companies, and using a strong software engineering basis for my PhD thesis. 

During my PhD I developed the open-source simulation platform [Presage2](http://www.presage2.info), a general-purpose simulation platform for agent-based simulation written in Java. I continue to maintain this open-source project, which has a growing user-based, seeing use in three research groups and appearing in 12 academic publications to this date.

Further information about software I have developed can be found on the [projects](/projects) page.
