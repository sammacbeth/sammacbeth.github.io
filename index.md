Hi, I'm Sam and I write code that keeps you private.

I'm a Privacy Engineer at DuckDuckGo, and previously worked at [Cliqz](https://cliqz.com) on their anti-tracking technology, which can also be found 
in [Ghostery](https://www.ghostery.com).

I also experiment with how we can make the web, and web browsers, empower users with local-first and p2p
technology, such as [Dat](//dat.foundation). I build the [Dat-Webext](https://github.com/cliqz-oss/dat-webext) extension which adds support for Dat to Firefox-based browsers.

You can see a selection of the projects I work on [here](/projects.html), check out my [CV](/about.html), or
read some of my [blog posts](/posts/).
