title: About Me
---

I'm a software developer and PhD graduate based in Munich, Germany. I am currently working at [Cliqz](https://cliqz.com/en/aboutus), developing innovative, user-empowering, and privacy-preserving software in the browser. Specifically, this is Cliqz' [anti-tracking](https://cliqz.com/en/whycliqz/anti-tracking) system, which prevents [online tracking](https://cliqz.com/en/magazine/how-we-at-cliqz-protect-users-from-web-tracking) of our users. 

I completed my PhD in 2015 at Imperial College London, studying the application of self-organising governance to computational systems which gather information and knowledge. My work is published in peer-reviewed journals, books and conference proceedings, and can be found on the [research](/research) page.

During my PhD I developed the open-source simulation platform [Presage2](http://www.presage2.info), a general-purpose simulation platform for agent-based simulation written in Java. I continue to maintain this open-source project, which has a growing user-base, seeing use in three research groups and appearing in 12 academic publications to this date.

Further information about software I have developed can be found on the [projects](/projects) page.

I occasionally post things on the [posts](/posts) page.
