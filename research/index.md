My research focuses on applying theories about human organisations' management of resources, specifically information and knowledge, and applying them to computational systems in order to improve reliability, efficiency and fairness in open computational systems. These are systems where multiple independent agents pursue their own, often diverse, goals, through interacting with each other and a shared resource. The major challenge in these systems is firstly, devising rules which will foster more efficient and sustainable cooperative behaviour between these agents, and secondly, preventing non-compliance with these rules from under-mining the original rules.
