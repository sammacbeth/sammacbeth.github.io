I've written a couple of blog posts explaining how online tracking works, and about how the system we've built at CLIQZ protects against it. Read about it on the CLIQZ blog:

 * [Part 1: Online tracking background and reach](https://cliqz.com/en/magazine/how-facebook-knows-exactly-what-turns-you-on)
 * [Part 2: How CLIQZ's anti-tracking works](https://cliqz.com/en/magazine/how-we-at-cliqz-protect-users-from-web-tracking)
