'Tracking the trackers', a paper I co-authors with colleagues at [Cliqz](https://cliqz.com), was presented today at the [World Wide Web Conference](http://www2016.ca).

[The paper](http://www2016.net/proceedings/proceedings/p121.pdf) surveys user tracking on the web, and presents the state-of-the-art anti-tracking system we have developed at Cliqz. Slides of the talk are also available [here](http://www.slideshare.net/jmpujol/tracking-the-trackers-www-2016).
