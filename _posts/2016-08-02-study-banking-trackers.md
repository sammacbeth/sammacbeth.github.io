title: Study: User tracking in online banking

My study on third-party trackers observed on German online-banking portals is now available as a [whitepaper](https://cliqz.com/content/2-aboutus/3-presse/9-pressemitteilung-cliqz-tracking-beim-online-banking/cliqz-study-tracking-in-online-banking.pdf).

The study shows that several banks employ trackers on their login or logout pages, and thus allowing the third-party trackers to infer custom of a particular bank for the tracked user. This ties in with my ongoing work on developing the Anti-tracking system available in the [Cliqz Browser](https://cliqz.com) - which prevents the tracking presented in the study.
